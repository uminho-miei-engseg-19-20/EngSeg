## Exercises



### 1. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (S-SDLC)

#### Experience 2.1

At what pahse of the waterfall model should the European GDPR regulation be taken into account?


#### Question P2.1

At what pahse of the _Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle_ model should the European GDPR regulation be taken into account?

#### Experience 2.2

1. In what business function, security practice and SAMM activity should the European GDPR regulation be taken into account?

2. At what level of maturity of this safety practice does the company have to be, to take into account the GDPR European regulation in its projects? Justify.

#### Question P2.2

This question should be answered by even-numbered groups.

In any of the S-SDLC it is fundamental in the Requirements phase to identify the security requirements, which must be based on the current legislation and international recommendations and standards (ISO 27000 family), as applicable, and must be translated into specific requirements for the software to be developed.

The ISO / IEC 27002: 2013
_Information technology - Security techniques - Code of practice for information security controls_ provides guidelines for information security standards and information security management practices in an organization, including the selection, implementation and management of security controls, taking into account the environment of information security risk of the organization.

Analyse the safety controls in the following sections:

+ 14.2 _Security in development and support processes_
+ 10.1 _Cryptographic controls_

What can you conclude about the use of these controls in the software development project that your group is developing for this discipline or for other disciplines?

Note: You can find ISO / IEC 27002: 2013 [here][c7520f71].

#### Question P2.3


This question should be answered by odd-numbered groups.

The _National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-64, Security Considerations in the System Development Life Cycle_, was developed to assist Federal Government Agencies
to integrate the IT security components into the software lifecycle development (SDLC) that they use.

Analyse section 2.3 (_Key Roles and Responsibilities in the SDLC_). What can you conclude about the SDLC security roles and responsibilities compared to the software development projects in which you have participated?

Note: You can find NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-64 in the directory [Aula13](Aula13/10.nistspecialpublication800-64r2.pdf).


### 2. SAMM (_Software Assurance Maturity Model_)

In this section you are asked to use the SAMM continuous improvement cycle applied to your Security Engineering project (project 3).

To do this you must use the Toolbox ([excel file](Aula13/SAMM_Assessment_Toolbox_v1.5_FINAL.xlsx)) provided in the directory [Aula13](Class 13), where
you will find more information regarding SAMM.

Note that:

+ For the _Assess_ Phase you must fill in the _sheet_ "_Interview_";
+ For the _Set the Target_ Phase, the group should discuss the _score_ objective of the identified security practices. If you need assumptions, indicate them in the justification of the decision made;
+ For the _Define the Plan_ Phase you should fill in the _sheet_ "_Roadmap_", assuming that each phase is 3 months long. Take into account the effort required and the possible dependence between activities in each of the phases.

Note that there are no right or wrong answers.



#### Question P2.1

Identify the maturity of three security practices (of your choice) that you use in the development of the Security Engineering  project (SAMM _Assess_ phase)

#### Question P2.2

For each of the security practices identified in the previous question, set the target for it (SAMM _Set the Target_ phase), i.e. the desired maturity level;


#### Question P2.3

Develop the plan to achieve the desired maturity level identified in the previous question, in four phases (SAMM _Define the Plan_ phase).
