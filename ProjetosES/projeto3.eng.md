# Engenharia de Segurança - Project

## Project 3 - Secure software development

### Code and Report

The code and report should be made available in the space that was made available for your Group on the UC's Github (https://github.com/uminho-miei-engseg-19-20), in a directory with the name "projeto3" until the end of the 06/07/2020.


If the project is not finished on the 06/07/2020, you can deliver it until the end of 13/07/2020 - for each day of delay (in relation to 06/07/2020) 0.5 values will be discounted (score of 0 - 20) to the final grade of this project.

### Presentation

The oral presentation (30 minutes) will be made in the "UC Engenharia de Segurança" Zoom room (at https://zoom.us/j/970921318?pwd=c3haUDRRWStJYjk1RE9YTnpzVWdJdz09), where the group can share the screen.


Before making the presentation **YOU MUST** try to access the room and understand how you can share the screen, so that you don't waste time with these details during the presentation.


The group will have 20-25 minutes for presentation, followed by 5-10 minutes for questions and discussion. At the end of the presentation, the file that served as support (ppt, pdf, ...) must be placed in the "projeto3" directory (see "Code and Report" section).


#### Date and time

To be determined with the group - please send me mail with several options for the week of 20/July/2020.
