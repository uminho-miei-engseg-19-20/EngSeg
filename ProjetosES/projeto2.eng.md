# Engenharia de Segurança - Project

## Project 2 - software quality tools and / or software tests

### Report

The report should be made available in the space that was made available for your Group on the UC's Github (https://github.com/uminho-miei-engseg-19-20), in a directory with the name "projeto2" by the end of the 10/05/2020.


### Presentation

The oral presentation (30 minutes) in class format will be made in the "UC Engenharia de Segurança" Zoom room (at https://zoom.us/j/970921318?pwd=c3haUDRRWStJYjk1RE9YTnpzVWdJdz09), where the group can share the screen, and the rest of your colleagues can attend (everyone can attend remotely).

This room is active until the end of the semester, and can be used between 8 am and 10 pm (at least that's what I chose, but I never tried to book for so long - if it has to be changed, you will find on this page the correct link to the room).

Before making the presentation **YOU MUST** try to access the room and understand how you can share the screen, so that you don't waste time with these details during the presentation.


The group will have 20-25 minutes for presentation, followed by 5-10 minutes for questions and discussion. At the end of the presentation, the file that served as support (ppt, pdf, ...) must be placed in the "projeto2" directory (see "Report" section).


#### Date and time
