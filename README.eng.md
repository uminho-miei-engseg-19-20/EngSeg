- After the presentation of project 1, each member of the Working Group has to send an evaluation of the various members of the Group (including himself) by email, to the UC professor (see email in the slides of class 1). This evaluation is between 0 and 100 (with 100 being the highest value), and compares the work that each member of the group has done in the project.
- According to discussion and voting in slack, there will be no written exame. Slide 7 of class 1 was changed to conform to this decision.
